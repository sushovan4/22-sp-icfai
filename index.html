                    Good afternoon, everyone. I would like to first thank
                    Vincent for the invitation and the Applied Math group at
                    Hunter for hosting the HCAM seminar series. It's a great
                    initiative.
                    <br>
                    I go by Sush. I am fresh graduate from Tulane University,
                    New Orleans; Currently a postdoc at the School of
                    Information, UC Berkeley.

                    I have tried to make the ride today as gentle as possible
                    for the audience. To better cusion it, I will try use a lot
                    of pictures and visualization tools -- sparing you of all
                    the bells and whistles and the mathematical proofs.
                    Although, an interested audience is welcome to call on our
                    papers online. I will put the pointers at some point.

                        Alongside instructing statistics at UCB, I have been
                        continuing my research broadly in data science. Although
                        I take a keen interest in questions arising in
                        topological data analysis, computational topology and
                        computational geometry, I always keep an eye out for
                        practical problems where I can test my topological

                    Here is roughly what I envision to cover today! We open up
                    with a brief, introductory note about Topological data
                    analysis (TDA). Following it, I introduce the reconstruction
                    problem. Along the way, we try to take a stab at solving the
                    problem. To that end, we introduce Vietoris-Rips complexes,
                    then come up with a possible solution. Before drawing the
                    curtain, we talk about opportunities in TDA for researchers
                    and students alike.

                        In 2015, as a young graduate student when I was on the
                        hunt for good projects, I was drawn in by the
                        application of topology and geometry in data science.
                        Still in its cradle at the time, TDA could attract only
                        a few hundred researchers in the states and could afford
                        only one or two major conferences and workshops around
                        the year.
                        <br>
                        Topology, after all, is a branch of geometry---it is
                        the systematic study of similarity of abstract shapes,
                        or topological spaces through various invariants, like
                        homology groups, cohomology rings, homotopy groups, and
                        so on. 
                        <br>
                        It's difficult to say how or when TDA started to take
                        shape, but in the early years of the first decade of the
                        century, computer scientists showed an interest to
                        algorithmcally compute those topological invariants. The
                        domain is now called Computational Topology.

                        Around the same time, there was an effort to employ
                        topological ideas to solve practical problems, e.g., ... 
                        <br>
                        Emboldened by the success of computational and applied
                        topology in providing tanable solutions to practical
                        problems, the TDA community emerged to bestow a
                        topological toolkit on the realm of data science. 

                        <br>
                        It straddles between computational topology and applied
                        topology affording methods inspired by a fair count of
                        ideas from both topology, geometry, and computer
                        science. TDA now is growing apace, it is a field no
                        longer esoteric to applied mathematicians, a name not so
                        unheard of in the mainstream data science. Business
                        ventures like Ayasdi even took it to the silicony

                    It's very commmon to talk about things that we have done
                    recently. The lion's share of my PhD work entails the famous
                    problem in TDA: reconstruction of geometric shapes from a
                    noisy sample around it. In particular, today we talk about
                    reconstruction of a special class of shapes: the geodesic
                    spaces. We will especially talk about the reconstruction
                    techniques that we put forward. 
                    <br><br>
                    Before we formally define the reconstruction problem, let's
                    talk about shapes.

                        Pretty much whatever we see can be called a shape. In
                        topology though, shapes are distinguished by the
                        topological features they manifest. The best class of
                        shapes one always hopes to deal with is smooth manifolds
                        smoothly embedded in Euclidean space.
                        <br><br>
                        For example, the smooth closed curve embedded in the
                        plane on the left and the hollow torus embedded in the
                        space on the right.

                        However, more often than not, practical applications
                        deal with shapes that are far from being a smooth
                        manifold. The map of the neighborhood of Hunter can be
                        modelled as a graph, where the intersections are thought
                        of as the vertices, whereas the roads the edges.
                        <br> 
                        Clearly, a graph is NOT a manifold -- because of the
                        branchings at the intersections and the corners.
                        <br> 
                        As our story unfolds, we will see that our
                        reconstruction results can handle smooth manifolds also
                        graphs -- as well as more sophisticated and general
                        class of shapes -- which we call geodesic spaces.

                        So, we first get the definition straight.
                        <br> In geometry, a geodesic mimics the concept of
                        SHORTEST PATH between two points on a graph.
                        <br> Explain the picture.
                        <br> Define geodesic spaces
                        <br> It is evident from the definition that a graph is a
                        geodesic space, so is the road-network around Hunter.
                        Also any compact, sub-manifold of the Euclidean space is
                        a geodesic space. Higher dimensional simplicial
                        complexes are also examples of geodesic spaces.
                        <br> For the curious audience, the sphere -- if
                        punctured at a point -- no longer remains a geodesic
                        space.

                        reconstruction.
                        <br> Our goal is very simple. Let's ask the data
                        analytics question: Given a chunk of points --- called a
                        sample --- in our case a point-cloud --- What can we
                        say?

                        if I whisper to you that the points are sampled from a
                        shape that a topologist might care about --- can we
                        guess what the original shape was?

                        find a reconstruction. Our sample S is discrete set of

                        Instead of looking at Rips complex only at one scale

                        --- but we kill them at the larger scale. At the end,
                        the surviving cycles generate the desired homology
